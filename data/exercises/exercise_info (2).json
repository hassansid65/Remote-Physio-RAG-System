Preparation:  \r\n   - Identify the target muscle group that requires stretching.  \r\n   - Ensure the client is in a comfortable position to perform the stretch.  \r\n\r\n2. Isometric Contraction:  \r\n   - The client contracts the target muscle isometrically (without movement) against resistance provided by the practitioner or external force.  \r\n   - Hold the contraction for 3 to 7 seconds.  \r\n\r\n3. Relaxation Phase:  \r\n   - After the contraction, the client releases the effort, allowing the muscle to relax.  \r\n   - This relaxation phase utilizes the post-isometric relaxation (PIR) principle, where the neurological activity in the muscle decreases, creating a \"window\" for effective stretching.  \r\n\r\n4. Stretching:  \r\n   - Immediately following the relaxation phase, the practitioner or client stretches the target muscle.  \r\n   - Hold the stretch for 3 to 7 seconds.  \r\n\r\n5.

Once the LTR is identified, apply MRTs using isometric contractions:\r\n   - Engage the muscle gently to a barrier of resistance.\r\n   - Hold until a release phenomenon is achieved.\r\n5. Optionally, apply light ischemic compression for surface trigger points:\r\n   - Use just enough pressure to engage the resistance barrier.\r\n   - Avoid excessive force to prevent muscle contraction as a defensive response.\r\n6. Repalpate the muscle to confirm the release of the trigger point.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nB. Shortened Muscle Release (Passive or Semi-Active):\r\n1. Perform a length test to confirm decreased range of motion.\r\n2. Begin with MRTs to relax the muscle:\r\n   - If successful, the muscle will release to a new resting length.\r\n   - If unsuccessful, connective tissue changes are likely present.\r\n3. For superficial muscles (e.g., pectoralis major):\r\n   - Perform myofascial release by folding the muscle perpendicularly against itself.\r\n   - Hold until a release is sensed, then take out the slack.\r\n   - This avoids triggering the stretch reflex.\r\n4.

General Principles for Movement and Gait Improvement  \r\n   - Purpose: To improve mobility, balance, and gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease.  \r\n   - Target Body Parts/Muscle Groups: Lower extremities, core muscles, and overall coordination.  \r\n   - Performance Instructions:  \r\n     - Break down complex actions into smaller steps and perform one step at a time.  \r\n     - Avoid multitasking during movement (e.g., focus solely on walking rather than combining walking with other tasks).  \r\n     - Pay attention to each movement and consciously rehearse difficult movements before performing them.  \r\n     - Talk through movements to ensure focus and precision.\r\n\r\n2. Specific Strategies for Mobility Problems  \r\n   - Purpose: To address specific gait challenges and reduce fall risk.  \r\n   - Performance Instructions:  \r\n     - Imagine lines on the floor and perform high stepping over them to improve stride.  \r\n     - Overcome start hesitation by rocking gently forward and backward or walking in time with a tune.  \r\n     - Focus on \"heel-first\" walking and consciously aim for long strides.  \r\n     - Turn safely by walking in a large circle and avoiding sudden changes in direction.  \r\n     - Avoid carrying items while walking; use a small rucksack to keep hands free for balance.  \r\n     - Maintain a stable base by keeping feet approximately 8 inches (20 cm) apart.  \r\n     - Stand to one side when opening doors to avoid backward steps.  \r\n     - When walking outside, time journeys to coincide with periods of maximum mobility, allow extra time to avoid rushing, and pay attention to obstacles (e.g., deliberately lift feet higher to step over curbs).\r\n\r\n3. Rehabilitation or Fitness Benefits:  \r\n   - Improves balance, gait, and mobility.  \r\n   - Reduces fall risk and promotes safer movement.  \r\n   - Enhances confidence and reduces anticipatory fear of falling.  \r\n   - Encourages physical activity, which may help prevent muscle weakness and osteoporosis.\r\n\r\n4. Precautions or Contraindications:  \r\n   - Avoid multitasking during movement to prevent clumsiness or instability."},{"Full Path":"Neuro > Assessment > how_to_examine_the_nervous_system__2006-02-24_-_1588298116_-_robert_t._ross_-_humana_press_.pdf > 153","Processed Summary":"Official/Specific Exercise Name:\r\n- Heel Tapping and Heel Sliding\r\n\r\nPrimary Purpose:\r\n- To assess and improve lower limb coordination\r\n\r\nTarget Body Parts/Muscle Groups:\r\n- Lower limbs, specifically targeting coordination between the feet and legs\r\n\r\nDetailed Step-by-Step Performance Instructions:\r\n1.

Active Muscle Lengthening:\r\n   - The stretcher actively lengthens the target muscle (e.g., hamstring) to its maximal pain-free end range, referred to as the soft tissue barrier or stretch barrier.\r\n   - Example: To stretch the hamstrings, the stretcher lies on their back and contracts the quadriceps and psoas to actively lift the leg as high as possible while keeping the knee straight. The partner may assist by holding the knee straight during the movement.\r\n   - This active movement incorporates reciprocal inhibition, where contracting the hip flexors causes the hamstrings to relax.\r\n\r\n2. Partner Positioning for Resistance:\r\n   - The partner positions themselves to offer resistance for the stretcher to isometrically contract the target muscle against.\r\n   - Example: For hamstring stretching, the partner supports the stretcher’s lower leg either against their shoulder or by holding it with both hands.\r\n\r\n3. Isometric Contraction:\r\n   - The stretcher begins a slow isometric contraction of the target muscle (e.g., hamstrings) by \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" against the partner’s resistance.\r\n   - The partner provides matching resistance, ensuring the stretcher does not overpower them.\r\n   - The isometric contraction is held for 6 to 10 seconds, stimulating the Golgi tendon organs, which induces postisometric relaxation.\r\n\r\n4.
