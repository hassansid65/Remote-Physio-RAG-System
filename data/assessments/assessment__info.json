Patient attempts to bring the elbow to the side against resistance until a 'bind' is felt at the AC joint.\r\n     2. Apply counterpressure at the patient's elbow, asking the patient to move the elbow towards the floor with less than full strength for 7-10 seconds.\r\n     3.

Primary Purpose: \r\n   - The primary purpose of this assessment is to analyze an individual's ability to perform various functional activities and measure their capacity to engage in these activities successfully. This involves understanding both the habitual level of a patient's abilities and their maximum capacity to perform certain tasks, regardless of whether they typically perform them.\r\n\r\n2. Target Body Parts/Muscle Groups:\r\n   - The assessment targets multiple body parts and muscle groups as it encompasses a range of functional mobility skills (FMS), including bed mobility, transfers, locomotion (wheelchair mobility, ambulation, negotiation of stairs and graded elevations, walking for longer distances in the community).\r\n\r\n3. Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for Performing the Assessment:\r\n   - The text does not provide specific step-by-step instructions for performing the assessment.

Expected Outcomes or Measurements:\r\n   - The expected outcomes include baseline information for setting function-oriented goals, indicators of a patient’s initial abilities and progression, criteria for placement decisions, manifestations of an individual’s level of safety in performing tasks, and evidence of the effectiveness of specific interventions.\r\n\r\n5. Potential Precautions or Contraindications:\r\n   - While specific precautions or contraindications are not detailed, the text implies the importance of choosing appropriate tests and measures based on the patient’s habitual function versus capacity. It also suggests the need to coordinate testing to reduce duplication and unnecessary patient stress, indicating a general precaution in the administration of functional tests.\r\n\r\n6. Additional Notes:\r\n   - Physical therapists, often in collaboration with other health professionals like occupational therapists and nurses, are responsible for administering these functional tests, especially in settings where a multidisciplinary team exists. In noninstitutional settings or in the absence of a team, physical therapists may handle all aspects of physical function testing. The choice of setting for the tests should be conducive to the type of testing and free of distractions."},{"Full Path":"General > Phys_Rehab_by_Susan_O_Sullivan.pdf > 549","Processed Summary":"1.

Apply pressure gently but firmly to assess the sensitivity. Adjust the pressure based on the depth of the tissue being palpated, with deeper tissues requiring more pressure.\r\n     - Pressure Sensitivity Grading: Use a grading system as shown in Fig. 4-2 to categorize the severity of tenderness at each point:\r\n       - Extremely sensitive: Full circle shaded, visual jump sign present.\r\n       - Very sensitive: Top half of the circle filled, no jump sign but patient reports high tenderness.\r\n       - Moderately sensitive: Bottom half of the circle filled, some tenderness reported without a jump sign.\r\n       - No tenderness: Circle left blank.\r\n   - Expected Outcomes or Measurements: The assessment results in a graded sensitivity scale of tender points, which helps in diagnosing the severity and extent of tissue reaction.\r\n   - Potential Precautions or Contraindications: Care must be taken to adjust pressure based on patient sensitivity, age, and physical condition to avoid excessive discomfort or misinterpretation of tender points.

Move the affected joint (e.g., elbow) towards the barrier or just before it in the restricted direction.\r\n    3.

Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for Performing the Assessment:\r\n- Swelling Evaluation:\r\n  1. Observe the timing of swelling development:\r\n     - Immediately to within 2 hours: Indicates damage to a structure with a rich blood supply (e.g., hematoma, dislocation, fracture).\r\n     - 6 to 24 hours: Suggests synovial irritation (e.g., capsular or ligament sprain, joint subluxation).\r\n     - After activity only: May indicate chronic bursitis or irritation of the synovium (e.g., bone fragment).\r\n  2. Assess the location and characteristics of the swelling:\r\n     - Diffuse swelling extending into the joint suggests hemarthrosis (e.g., intra-articular fracture, severe traumatic effusion).\r\n     - Swelling from a direct blow may indicate muscular or soft tissue damage.\r\n\r\n- Range of Motion (ROM) Evaluation:\r\n  1.

Interpret findings:\r\n     - Significant ROM limitations or reluctance to move may indicate:\r\n       - Substantial injury (e.g., second-degree ligament injury, fracture).\r\n       - Psychological fear of movement due to pain or trauma.\r\n     - Joint effusion will typically limit both flexion and extension.\r\n  3.

Target Body Parts/Muscle Groups: The target body part for this assessment is the medial aspect of the elbow, focusing on the medial collateral ligament.\r\n\r\n4. Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for Performing the Assessment:\r\n   - The patient should be seated or standing with the arm relaxed.\r\n   - The examiner will slightly flex the patient's elbow to approximately 25% of full flexion.\r\n   - The examiner applies a valgus force (a force pushing laterally on the elbow) to stress the medial collateral ligament.\r\n   - Observation and palpation are used to detect any signs of pain, laxity, or abnormal movement in the medial elbow region.\r\n\r\n5. Expected Outcomes or Measurements: Positive signs of this test include pain localized to the medial elbow or increased laxity compared to the contralateral side. These findings might suggest damage to the MCL.\r\n\r\n6. Potential Precautions or Contraindications:\r\n   - This test should be performed carefully to avoid causing additional injury.\r\n   - It is contraindicated or should be performed with caution in patients with acute injury and severe pain.\r\n   - Proper assessment of the patient's pain threshold and tolerance before applying force is crucial to avoid exacerbating the injury.\r\n\r\nThis assessment is part of a broader diagnostic approach to managing athletes, particularly baseball players, who present with medial elbow pain, potentially due to repetitive stress activities like throwing.

Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for Performing the Assessment:\r\n   - Begin with the patient in a comfortable and relaxed position, either sitting or lying down.\r\n   - The therapist uses their hands to palpate the spinal segments, feeling for any signs of asymmetry, hypermobility (excessive movement), or hypomobility (restricted movement).\r\n   - The therapist may apply localized movement or pressure during palpation to reproduce the patient's symptoms and further assess the condition.\r\n   - Note any gross losses of movement or specific areas that trigger pain or discomfort.\r\n\r\n5. Expected Outcomes or Measurements:\r\n   - Identification of symptomatic levels of the spine where pathology might exist.\r\n   - Detection of gross movement restrictions or specific areas causing pain, which could indicate underlying issues such as intervertebral motion restrictions or pathology in the intervertebral segments.\r\n\r\n6. Potential Precautions or Contraindications:\r\n   - Palpation should be performed carefully to avoid exacerbating any existing pain or discomfort.\r\n   - The reliability of palpation as a sole diagnostic tool is questioned; it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic assessments.\r\n   - Intertester reliability is generally low, indicating that findings might vary significantly between different therapists.\r\n\r\nThis assessment primarily utilizes palpation as a diagnostic tool in the context of manual therapy for spinal disorders, focusing on detecting physical abnormalities through tactile examination."},{"Full Path":"Orthopedic > Treatment > THE_CERVICAL_AND_THORACIC_SPINE_--_Mecahnical_Diagnosis_and_Therapy.pdf > 88","Processed Summary":"1.
